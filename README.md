# Content-Based-Movie-Recommendation-System-in-Python
In this project a content-based movie recommender system was built using Natural Language Processing. 
The dataset used have over 45,000 movie overviews and it is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ibtesama/getting-started-with-a-movie-recommendation-system/data?select=movies_metadata.csv).
After the preliminary data cleaning and text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorizer and the unsupervised Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modeling algorithm was used to extract topics from the movies overview corpus. Then the cosine similarity metric was used among the movie topic profiles to create a content-based recommendation system.
